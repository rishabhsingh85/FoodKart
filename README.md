# FoodKart 🍔
FoodKart is a simple and clean web-based food ordering platform built using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website lets users view popular food items, explore the full menu, and access a separate cart page to manage selected items.

This project is designed as part of my learning in full stack web development and focuses mainly on structuring and organizing a multi-page food ordering interface.
